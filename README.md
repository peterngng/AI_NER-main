# Legal Named Entity Recognition (NER) Project

This repository contains code and instructions for using a legal domain-specific Named Entity Recognition (NER) model. It includes both a baseline pre-trained model and a custom-trained version for improved performance.

---

## üì¶ Testing the Baseline Model

### 1. Install the pre-trained baseline model

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
pip install https://huggingface.co/opennyaiorg/en_legal_ner_trf/resolve/main/en_legal_ner_trf-3.2.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

### 2. Run the baseline model

```bash
python run_legal_ner.py
```

This script will run the baseline model and display the output in your browser for easy visualization of the extracted entities.

## üõ† Using the Designed Model

Our designed model is located in the `training` folder and includes the best-trained configuration for improved performance.

### Components

- `best_model`: The best-trained version of the custom model.
- `train2.py`: Script to train the model using provided datasets.
- `pred.py`: Script to predict legal entities from documents.
- `evaluate2.py`: Script to evaluate the model and calculate performance metrics.
- `check.py` and `check_label.py`: Scripts to ensure data integrity and validate dataset labels.

---

## üöÄ Steps to Use the Designed Model

### 1. Train the Model

Use `train2.py` to train the model with your dataset:

```bash
python ./training/train2.py
```

### 2. Make Predictions

Use `pred.py` to predict legal entities on new documents:

```bash
python training/pred.py
```

### 3. Evaluate the Model

Run `evaluate2.py` to calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics:

```bash
python ./training/evaluate2.py
```

### 4. Check Data Integrity

Use `check.py` and `check_label.py` to verify the integrity of your dataset:

```bash
python ./training/check.py
python ./training/check_label.py
```
